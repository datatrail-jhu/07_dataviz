# Data Visualization Project

Throughout this course set, we'll have a number of projects for you to complete. This is the second project of the course set. All of these will be included as Exercises. This means they will *not* be required to pass the course and receive your certificate; however, completing them will *really* help to improve your understanding of the material covered and to ensure that you've begun to master the skills needed to be a data scientist.

In each project, we'll aim to get you started and to ask questions that will help guide you through the project. But, we'll intentionally leave pieces out where you have to figure out what needs to be done.

This project will require you to:

* carry out an exploratory data analysis
* wrangle data
* generate exploratory plots
* generate explanatory plots

You can access the project by going to the exercise accompanying this lesson.

## Data Visualization Project

Data Visualization is an incredibly important skill for a data scientist. Being able to generate exploratory visualizations that help you understand the data and explanatory visualizations so that your findings

As such, this exercise has been generated to practice your, GitHub, terminal navigation, RStudio, and data wrangling skills.

### GitHub Setup

To get started, you'll want to go to GitHub and start a new repository:

- Call this repository `dataviz_project`.
- Add a short description
- Check the box to "Initialize this repository with a README.
- Click `Create Repository`

Once the repository has been created, Click on `Clone or download` and copy the "Clone with HTTPS" link provided. You'll use this to clone your repo in RStudio Cloud.

**Note**: If you're stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: [Version Control](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/version-control). Refer to the materials in this course if you're stuck on this part of the project.

### RStudio Cloud Setup

- Go to the [Cloud-based Data Science Space on RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/20345/join?access_code=n4b8J1s0XmWctSy83%2BEXbGAwj7rKcuFMI7WJEJFD)
- Click on the "Projects" tab at the top of the workspace
- Make a copy of the project: `dataviz_project`

In this project you should see a `dataviz_project.Rmd ` file. You'll use this to get started working on your project!

*Note*: If you try to Knit this document at this time, you *will* get an error because there is code in this document that has to be edited (by you!) before it will be able to successfully knit!

To start using version control, you'll want to clone the GitHub repository you just created into this workspace. To do so, go to the Terminal and clone your project into this workspace.

A new directory with the name of your GitHub repository should now be viewable in the Files tab of RStudio Cloud. You are now set up to track your project with git.

### Data Science Project Setup

As discussed previously, you'll want all your data science projects you be organized from the very beginning. Let's do that now!

First, use `cd` to get yourself into the directory of your GitHub Project.  

Once in the correct directory, use `mkdir` in the terminal to create folders with the following structure:

- data/
  - raw_data/
  - tidy_data/
- code/
  - raw_code/
  - final_code/
- figures/
  - exploratory_figures/
  - explanatory_figures/
- products/
  - writing/

Now that your directories are set up you'll want to use the Terminal (or 'More' drop-down menu in the Files tab) to **move (`mv`) the `dataviz_project.Rmd ` file into code/raw_code** and the **two .csv files in data/raw_data into the data/raw_data directory in *your* version controlled repository**. This ensures that your code file and raw data are in the correct directory.

Once the .Rmd document is in the correct folder, you'll want to **change the author of this document** to your name at the top of the .Rmd document (in the YAML). Save this change before moving to the next step.

**Note**: If you're stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: [Organizing Data Science Projects](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/organizingdatascienceprojects). Refer to the materials in this course if you're stuck on this part of the project.

### Pushing to GitHub

You'll want to save changes to your project regularly by pushing them to GitHub. Now that you've got your file structure set up and have added a code file (.Rmd) and two raw data files (.csv), it's a good time to stage, commit, and push these changes to GitHub. Do so now, and then take a long on GitHub to see the changes on their website!

**Note**: If you're stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: [Version Control](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/version-control). Refer to the materials in this course if you're stuck on this part of the project.

### Part 1: Exploratory Data Visualization

The first part of the project will guide you through a few steps to read the data in and explore the data. After you have a sense of what data are included in the dataset, you'll generate a number of exploratory plots.

To get started, first run the code in the `setup` code chunk. This will install and load all packages you'll need to complete this project.

#### The Data

The data we'll be using for this part of the project were downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/seattle-pet-licenses/data), and include information about "pet licenses issued by the Seattle Animal Shelter between 2005 and early 2017." We'll be exploring these data and generating a few exploratory plots in the first part of the project.

To load the data in, **run the code in the `pet-data` code chunk** to create an object called `pets`.

#### Explore the Data

Once the data have been read in, **explore the data**, **adding your code to `dataviz_project.Rmd`**, and then **answer the following questions**:

- How many pet licenses are included in the dataset?
- How many unique pet names are included in the dataset (`animal_s_name`)?
- How many different species are included in this dataset (`species`)?

Now that you have a handle on the data, let's start to generate some exploratory plots!

#### Visualize the Data

To visualize the data, we'll first guide you through a few code chunks that have partial code. After walking through these code chunks, you'll be prompted to write code to generate your own exploratory plot!

##### Bar Chart: `pet-barchart`

Start in the code chunk `visualize-pets`.

Here you will see comments with partial code underneath of them. For example, the first plot you'll want to generate will be using the comment  from the partial code:

```r
## visual breakdown of how many of each species
## are included in the dataset
ggplot(DATASET) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=VARIABLE))
```
Here, you'll have to **change `DATASET` and `VARIABLE` in the code** to the appropriate dataset and variable name in order to generate an exploratory plot. We'll want species name along the x and a count of how many are in each species along the y.

Feel free to customize your plots further using what you've learned about `ggplot2`!

After generating this figure, you'll be able to **answer the following questions**:

- Are there more dogs or cat licenses in this dataset?
- Approximately how many cat licenses are in this dataset?

##### Cat Table: `pet-cat-table`

After generating this first bar chart, move onto the code chunk `pet-cat-table`. Here you'll see the following partial code:

```r
## Table: Most frequent Cat Name
DATASET %>%
  filter(species=="SPECIES",VARIABLE != "") %>%
  group_by(VARIABLE) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  top_n(n=10) %>%
  kable(., caption = "Top 10 Cat Names in Seattle")
```
Here, you will need to **replace `DATASET`, `"SPECIES"`, and `VARIABLE` (in two places)** in order to get this code to run. Your table at the end should have information about the top 10 most frequent cat names

- What is the most common cat name?

##### Dog Table: `pet-dog-table`

Having successfully generated this table, move onto the `pet-dog-table` code chunk. *There is no code in here*. You'll need to **put all the necessary code in this code chunk**! Here, the goal is to create a similar table to what we just created; however, this should contain the 10 most frequent *dog* names, rather than cat names.

- What is the most common dog name?


##### Line Chart: `pet-linechart`

The last guided exploratory visualization you'll see is in the code chunk `pet-linechart`. Here, the code to create two new columns has been provided in full. You'll use the column `ym`, which creates a "year-month" variable, to generate your plot in just a second.

You will, however, have to **edit the partial code after `## how the number of licenses recorded has changed over time`**. Here, you'll need to **add the appropriate function_names to accomplish what is stated in the comment above the missing function name**. Additionally, you'll need to **fill in the appropriate variable wherever you see `VARIABLE`**. Finally, where you see `geom_GEOM`, **change "GEOM" to the appropriate geom specified in the comment above**.

```r
## add date and ym columns
pets <- pets %>%  
  mutate(date =  lubridate::ymd_hms(license_issue_date),
         ym = as.yearmon(pets$date, "%y%m"))

## how the number of licenses recorded has changed over time
pets %>%
  ## group by yearmonth (`ym`)
  function_name(VARIABLE) %>%
  ## count number within each group
  function_name(n=n()) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(VARIABLE, n)) +
  ## geom name for line chart
  geom_GEOM() +
  scale_x_yearmon() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of licenses")
```

After figuring out the missing pieces in the code and generating the plot, you'll be able to **answer the following questions**:

- What does the function `ymd_hms()` accomplish?
- What geom did you specify to generate a line chart?
- In what year do you see a huge jump in the number of pet licenses?


##### Create Your Own Exploratory Plot: `pet-plot`

After successfully generating two figures and two tables, it's time for you to **generate your own exploratory plot**! Explore the data and generate an additional exploratory plot that helps you better understand the data in this dataset. Include the code for this in the `pet-plot` code chunk.

### Pushing to GitHub

You'll want to save changes to your project regularly by **pushing them to GitHub**. Now that you've finished Part 1 of this project (yay!), it's a good time to stage, commit, and push these changes to GitHub. Do so now, and then take a long on GitHub to see the changes on their website!

**Note**: If you're stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: [Version Control](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/version-control). Refer to the materials in this course if you're stuck on this part of the project.


### Part 2: Explanatory Data Visualization

In the second part of the project, you'll work to generate an explanatory plot. Building on what you've done above, here, we'll again use `ggplot2`; however, we'll focus on the details in the appearance of the plot we generate to ensure that we're generating plots that effectively communicate the point we're trying to make to others.

#### The Data

The data used in this part of the project were dowloaded from [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) - `steak-survey`.  They were originally used in the article: [How Americans Like Their Steak](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-like-their-steak/). The goal of this part of the project will be to recreate the data visualization used in this article, which is re-printed here:


![steak survey data visualization from fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hickeydottle-steak-1-rd.png)

To get started, **run the code in the `meat-data` code chunk** to read the survey data into RStudio Cloud.

#### Explore the Data

Once the data have been read in, **explore the data**. **Add the code you use** to explore the data to the `meat-explore` code chunk in dataviz_project.Rmd, and **answer the following questions**:

- How many people participated in the survey?
- How  many people responded "Yes" to the question "Do you eat steak?"
- How many different (unique) responses were there to the question "How do you like your steak prepared?"

#### Wrangle the Data

**Run the code in the `meat-wrangle` code chunk** to get the data in the right format for you to generate the plot. Once you've run the code, **answer the following questions**:

- What does the code within the `mutate()` function accomplish in this code chunk?
- What does the code within the `filter()` function accomplish in this code chunk?
- How many columns are there in `pref`?
- What is contained in the column: `pref$prop`
- What is contained in the column: `pref$n`

#### Visualize the Data

To generate an explanatory figure, *some* of the code you'll need has been entered into the `meat-visualize` code chunk. Work through this code line by line, **replacing each `function_name` with the appropriate function to accomplish what the comment above the line states**.

For example, the first part of this code chunk contains the following partial code:

```r
## generate the plot
p <- ggplot(pref) +
  ## specify you want to generate a bar chart
  function_name(aes(x = steak_pref, y = prop, fill = steak_pref),
                stat = 'identity',
                width = 0.7)
```

Here, the comment says we want to `## specify you want to generate a bar chart`. This says to me that I'll want to change `function_name` to `geom_bar`, so that the code looks like this:

```r
## generate the plot
p <- ggplot(pref) +
  ## specify you want to generate a bar chart
  geom_bar(aes(x = steak_pref, y = prop, fill = steak_pref),
                stat = 'identity',
                width = 0.7)
```

After determining what function I need, I would then **run that portion of the code** (what you see above).

Note that we're assigning the plot to the object `p`. This means that to view the plot in the "Plots" tab you'll have to type `p` into the Console and hit enter after you run the code above. This will display the plot in the "Plots" tab of RStudio Cloud.

**Work through this code layer by layer** determining what `function_name` should be in each line of code. Note: **`function_name` should be the only thing you have to change in this code**.

? What function did you use to specify the colors of the bars in your bar chart?

! scale_fill_manual ; scale_fill_manual()

- What does `width = 0.7` accomplish in the code to generate the explanatory plot? (You can play around with the number to see how it changes the plot!)
- Without the line `legend.position="none"` what would change on the plot? (Try removing that line of code and regenerating the plot to see what changes!)

#### Save the Plot

Once you've worked through this code chunk and have a plot that looks very similar to the plot in the original publication (and that you see above), you'll want to use `ggsave()` to **save this plot to figures/explanatory_figures**. Save this figure as "steak_R.png". Do this using the partial code in the code chunk `save-plot`.

#### Create Your Own Exploratory Plot: `meat-plot`

Now, you'll want to **generate an explanatory figure on your own**. Use these data to generate a second explanatory plot. It should tell us something new about the data. You can use any column in the data frame. But, make sure that the figure is something that could be presented or shown to a boss. **Add this code to `meat-plot`**.

A quick reminder, generating plots can take a while. Be patient as you make mistakes. [Google](google.com) and [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com) are your friends - use them when you're stuck!

#### Save Your Explanatory plot

After you're happy with your very own explanatory plot, use `ggsave()` again to **save this plot to figures/explanatory_figures**. Be sure to use a filename other than "steak_R.png". You don't want to overwrite the plot you've already saved. **Add this code to the code chunk `save-meat-plot`.**

### Add Markdown Text to .Rmd

Before finalizing your project you'll want be sure there are **comments in your code chunks** and **text outside of your code chunks** to explain what you're doing in each code chunk. These explanations are incredibly helpful for someone who doesn't code or someone unfamiliar to your project.

**Note**: If you're stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: [Introduction to R](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/introduction-to-r). Refer to the R Markdown lesson in this course if you're stuck on this part (or the next part) of the project.

### Knit your R Markdown Document

Last but not least, you'll want to **Knit your .Rmd document into an HTML document**. If you get an error, take a look at what the error says and edit your .Rmd document. Then, try to Knit again! Troubleshooting these error messages will teach you a lot about coding in R.

### A Few Final Checks

A complete project should have:

- **Exploratory Analysis**
    - 3 plots (two guided ; one on your own)
    - 2 tables (one guided ; one on your own)
- **Explanatory Analysis**
    - 2 plots (one guided ; one on your own)
    - saved to figures/explanatory_figures
- Markdown text explaining your project
- Comments in your code chunk
- Answered all questions throughout this exercise

### Final `push` to GitHub

Now that you've finalized your project, you'll do one final **push to GitHub**. add, commit, and push your work to GitHub. Navigate to your GitHub repository, and answer the final question below!

**Note**: If you're stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: [Version Control](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/version-control). Refer to the materials in this course if you're stuck on this part of the project.

**Congrats on finishing your Data Visualization Project!!**
